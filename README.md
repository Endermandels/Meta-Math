### Description

Just a normal math quiz.  Nothing more...

TODO: Game Description (save for later)

- Developer Overview (Delete Later)

This game starts as a normal math quiz wherein an AI assistant poses each question
    and generally guides the player through the quiz.
The AI has a snarky/sarcastic personality and tends to insult the player.
However, the AI should have some sort of redeeming quality so that it is 
    not totally detestable.
That redeeming quality is yet to be developed.
The math quiz should act like a Choose Your Own Adventure Story with multiple
    splitting paths based on user input, and it should have different endings
    depending on which paths were used.
The game should have functionality which handles the player changing the Game Files.

#### Endings

TODO: Make secret some of the endings.

NOTE: Developer View!

- Competence    (CMP)

Player correctly answered all questions first time.

- Incompetence  (INC)

Player answered at least one question incorrect at some point in time.

- Neanderthal   (NEA)

Player answered all MDM questions incorrectly.

- Error         (ERR)

Player changed the game files or somehow made an illegal game state.

### TODOS

Each TODO item should be formatted like so:
#### {TODO}: {Contributer's Name}

#### Add Auto Save: Joey

Automatically save the game every time the player answers a
    question.

Status: Assigned

#### Brainstorm Game File Altering Path:

Brainstorm a path wherein the player alters the game files somehow.

Status: Unassigned

#### Brainstorm Better State Checking:

Currently, the state checking requires that the full player path matches
    the state path.
This method is cumbersome and can be improved.

Status: Unassigned
