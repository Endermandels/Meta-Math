### Compilation

TODO: Compilation Instructions (save for later)

### Description

Just a normal math quiz.  Nothing more...

TODO: Game Description (save for later)

- Developer Overview (Delete Later)

This game starts as a normal math quiz wherein an AI assistant poses each question
    and generally guides the player through the quiz.
The AI has a snarky/sarcastic personality and tends to insult the player.
However, the AI should have some sort of redeeming quality so that it is 
    not totally detestable.
That redeeming quality is yet to be developed.
The math quiz should act like a Choose Your Own Adventure Story with multiple
    splitting paths based on user input, and it should have different endings
    depending on which paths were used.
The game should have functionality which handles the player changing the Game Files.

#### Endings

TODO: Make secret some of the endings.

NOTE: Developer View!

- Competence    (CMP)

- Incompetence  (INC)

Player answered at least one question incorrect at some point in time.

- Retard        (RET)

- Error         (ERR)

    flat-out got some of them wrong.

#### Add Mentally-Disabled Mode (MDM):

When the player gets the first three questions wrong,
    the AI will turn on Mentally Disabled Mode,
    voicing the questions with caveman speech.
The AI will also ask the player if they want to turn
    the MDM if the player incorrectly answers the first
    two questions.
The player can exit MDM only by answering all of the
    questions correctly (or by manipulating the Game
    Files... somehow).

    all of the MDM questions.
