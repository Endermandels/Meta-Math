TODO: Game Description (save for later)

### TODOS

Each TODO item should be formatted like so:
- {TODO}: {Contributer's Name}

- Create checkState Method: Elijah

Check the state of the game to see which path to go on next.
Incorporate options from CSV file, if possible.

- Add Competence Ending:

This ending is achieved when the player correctly answers
    all of the questions the first time around.

- Add Incompetence Ending:

This ending is achieved when the player answers all of the
    questions, yet either had to redo some of them or
    flat-out got some of them wrong.

- Add Mentally-Disabled Mode (MDM):

When the player gets the first three questions wrong,
    the AI will turn on Mentally Disabled Mode,
    voicing the questions with caveman speech.
The AI will also ask the player if they want to turn
    the MDM if the player incorrectly answers the first
    two questions.
The player can exit MDM only by answering all of the
    questions correctly (or by manipulating the Game
    Files... somehow).

- Add Retard Ending:

This ending is achieved when the player incorrectly answers
    all of the MDM questions.

- Add Auto Save:

Automatically save the game every time the player answers a
    question.
