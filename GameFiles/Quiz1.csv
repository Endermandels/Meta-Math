Intro|Welcome to Meta Math Quiz.  This quiz will help you in your journey to learn how to do basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, raising to an exponent, taking a natural logarithm, taking a derivative, taking your sanity, taking an integral, and taking a square-root.  Fully simplify each of your answers, otherwise I will not accept your answers.  This course will be divided into three sections: Basic Math, Slightly Less Basic Math, and Basic Math for an Intelligent Computer Program.  Your results will be recorded.  Do NOT tamper with them.
